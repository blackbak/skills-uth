# Creative Angles

Default angle sets for the 3-team competition. The orchestrator selects the appropriate set based on the brief, or generates custom angles when defaults do not fit.

## Default Angles

### Angle A: Bold / Conversion-First

**Design direction:** High contrast, aggressive visual hierarchy, dominant CTAs, dark backgrounds with bright accents, large type, minimal navigation distractions.

**Copy direction:** Lead with pain. Amplify urgency. Concrete numbers over vague promises. Fear of missing out. Objection demolition. Short sentences that punch.

**Developer priority:** Fast load, single-scroll flow, sticky CTA, mobile-first conversion path.

### Angle B: Minimal / Refined

**Design direction:** Generous whitespace, typography-forward layout, muted palette with one accent, grid-based alignment, elegant transitions. Let content breathe.

**Copy direction:** Precision over volume. Each word earns its place. Understated confidence. Let the reader arrive at the conclusion themselves. Credibility through restraint.

**Developer priority:** Smooth scrolling, typographic scale, responsive fluid layout, subtle motion, performance-optimized images.

### Angle C: Unconventional / Distinctive

**Design direction:** Break one category convention deliberately. Unexpected layout (asymmetric, broken grid, horizontal scroll). Unusual color choices. Personality over polish. Memorable over safe.

**Copy direction:** Surprising angles. Challenge assumptions. Conversational or irreverent tone. Pattern interrupts. Metaphors from outside the category.

**Developer priority:** Creative interactions, CSS-driven effects, animated storytelling, scroll-triggered reveals.

## Category-Specific Angles

When the brief specifies a product category, override defaults with category-appropriate angles.

### SaaS / B2B

- **A:** ROI-driven (calculator, metrics, case study proof)
- **B:** Enterprise trust (security badges, compliance, integration logos)
- **C:** Developer-friendly (code snippets, API-first, dark theme)

### E-commerce / DTC

- **A:** Urgency + scarcity (limited stock, countdown, social proof)
- **B:** Lifestyle aspiration (editorial photography, story-driven)
- **C:** Community-driven (UGC, reviews-first, behind-the-scenes)

### Creator / Personal Brand

- **A:** Authority-first (credentials, media logos, testimonials)
- **B:** Story-first (narrative arc, vulnerability, journey)
- **C:** Community-first (tribe language, exclusive access, identity)

## Generating Custom Angles

When defaults do not fit the brief, generate angles by:

1. Identify the primary conversion goal from the brief
2. Research 3 competitor approaches in the category (use WebSearch)
3. Define 3 angles that each take a DIFFERENT strategic bet:
   - One angle bets on emotional resonance
   - One angle bets on rational proof
   - One angle bets on novelty / pattern interrupt
4. Write each angle using the same format: design direction, copy direction, developer priority
5. Ensure angles are genuinely different -- if two angles would produce similar pages, replace one
