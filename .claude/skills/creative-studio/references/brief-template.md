# Creative Brief: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deliverable:** [landing page | product page | component | email template | dashboard]
**Status:** active

## What to Build

[1-2 sentences describing the deliverable. Be specific: "A landing page for the Context4GPTs product launch targeting enterprise DevOps teams" not "a page for our product."]

## Target Audience

**Primary persona:** [Who is this for? Role, pain points, buying triggers]
**Context:** [Where do they encounter this? Paid ad? Organic search? Email link? Direct navigation?]
**Mindset:** [What are they thinking/feeling when they arrive? Skeptical? Curious? Ready to buy? Comparing options?]

## Key Constraints

- **Brand:** [Reference design system at docs/DESIGN/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md or note "no design system -- use creative judgment"]
- **Tech stack:** [HTML/CSS/JS | React | Next.js | Tailwind | etc.]
- **Must include:** [Specific elements that must be present -- logo, pricing, demo CTA, etc.]
- **Must avoid:** [Anything explicitly off-limits -- no pricing, no competitor mentions, etc.]
- **Responsive:** [Desktop + mobile | Desktop only | Mobile-first]

## Success Criteria

[How will this be measured? What does "good" look like? Conversion rate? Time on page? Scroll depth? Sign-ups?]

## Reference Materials

- [Links to competitor pages, inspiration, existing assets, brand guidelines]
- [Product docs: docs/PRODUCT/REFERENCE.md]
- [Marketing docs: docs/PRODUCT_MARKETING/REFERENCE.md]
- [Design system: docs/DESIGN/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md]
