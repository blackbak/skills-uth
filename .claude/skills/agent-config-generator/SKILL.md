# Agent Config Generator

Generate production-quality CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files that maximize AI coding agent effectiveness.

## When to Use

- Creating a new CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md file
- Updating existing agent configuration files
- Optimizing agent instructions for better performance
- Setting up a repository for AI-assisted development
- Reviewing and improving existing agent configurations

## Core Principles

### 1. Concise is Critical

CLAUDE.md goes into every conversation context. Each line has compounding cost across all sessions.

**Target lengths:**
- CLAUDE.md: ≤60 lines ideal, ≤150 lines max
- AGENTS.md: ≤150 lines ideal

**Test each line:** "Does the agent need this? Can the agent infer this from code?"

### 2. Base Standards + Project-Specific

Every generated CLAUDE.md has two layers:

1. **Base standards** from `references/base-standards.md` — philosophy, quality limits, error handling, testing, CLI preferences, commits, context management, agent teams, sandboxing, GitHub Actions. These are non-negotiable and apply to every project.
2. **Project-specific** sections — stack, structure, commands, conventions discovered by analyzing the target repo.

The base standards are the backbone. The project-specific sections wrap around them.

### 3. Three Essential Components (WHY, WHAT, HOW)

Every agent config must answer:

1. **WHAT** - Technology stack, project structure, codebase architecture
2. **WHY** - Project purpose, component functions, design decisions
3. **HOW** - Build commands, test procedures, verification methods

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Keep core files lean. Reference detailed docs elsewhere:

```
agent_docs/
├── building.md
├── testing.md
├── architecture.md
└── domain_terms.md
```

Direct agents to these files when relevant rather than duplicating content.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Base Standards

Read `references/base-standards.md` in this skill directory. These standards are always included in the generated CLAUDE.md. They cover:

- Philosophy (13 rules)
- Dependencies
- Code Quality Hard Limits
- Error Handling
- Testing
- CLI Tool Preferences (filter rows by target stack)
- Commits and PRs
- Code Review Order
- Completion Protocol (build, run, verify live, quality review)
- Context Management
- Agent Teams
- Sandboxing
- GitHub Actions

### Step 2: Analyze the Repository

Gather context before writing:

1. **Read project docs first**: Read all docs in `docs/` to understand the project:
   - `docs/PRODUCT/PRODUCT_DOCUMENT.md` — product identity, flows, business rules
   - `docs/PRODUCT_MARKETING/PRODUCT_MARKETING.md` — market position, competitors, growth mechanics
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design, components, ADRs
   - `docs/DEVELOPER/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` — API contracts, data models, patterns
   - `docs/DEVOPS/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md` — environments, deploy procedures, services
2. **Identify tech stack**: Languages, frameworks, package managers
3. **Map project structure**: Key directories, entry points, config files
4. **Discover workflows**: Build, test, lint, deploy commands
5. **Note conventions**: Naming patterns, file organization, code style
6. **Find existing docs**: README, CONTRIBUTING, existing agent configs

Use `scripts/analyze_repo.py` for automated detection.

### Step 3: Determine File Strategy

Choose which files to create:

| Scenario | Files to Create |
|----------|----------------|
| Claude-only usage | CLAUDE.md |
| Multi-agent/tool usage | AGENTS.md (universal) |
| Both Claude and others | Both files (CLAUDE.md for Claude-specific, AGENTS.md for universal) |

### Step 4: Generate CLAUDE.md

Combine base standards with project-specific content. Structure:

```markdown
# Development Standards

## Philosophy
[From base-standards.md — include all 13 rules verbatim]

## Dependencies
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## Code Quality Hard Limits
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## Error Handling
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## Testing
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## CLI Tool Preferences
[From base-standards.md — filter to rows relevant to detected stack.
Always include universal rows: fd, rg, ast-grep, trash.
Add stack-specific rows based on detected languages.]

## Commits and PRs
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## Code Review Order
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## Completion Protocol
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim.
Includes build, run, verify live, quality review, and commit gates.]

## Context Management
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## Agent Teams
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## Sandboxing
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim]

## GitHub Actions
[From base-standards.md — include verbatim.
Omit if project has no GitHub Actions.]
```

If the CLAUDE.md would exceed 150 lines with all base standards, move the less-referenced sections (Sandboxing, Agent Teams, Context Management) into a separate `agent_docs/workflow-standards.md` and reference it from CLAUDE.md.

### Step 5: Generate AGENTS.md (if needed)

Follow the structure from `references/templates.md`. Include the same base standards philosophy but adapted for multi-tool format.

### Step 6: Generate Coding Rules

Create `.claude/rules/coding-rules.md` with the critical subset of philosophy rules in emphatic tone, referencing CLAUDE.md for the full set:

```markdown
# Coding Rules

CRITICAL RULES
- No backwards compatibility. No legacy code. Rewrite, build, test, deploy, run.
- NO RE-EXPORTS. Especially from shared. Shared is the main contract between the services.
- NO remapping data with minimal change. Reuse the same stuff.
- ABSOLUTELY NO BLOAT. EVERY LINE OF CODE THAT YOU WRITE SHOULD BE MEANINGFUL. If you don't think it is then you should refactor something existing to solve the problem.
- We are writing strict typed code.
- ALL ISSUES ARE ISSUES. THERE ARE NO MINOR ISSUES. THERE IS NO FIXING LATER.
- NEVER EVER NEVER use hardcoded values. If you need to set something put it in env vars or SOLVE IT PROPERLY.

See /CLAUDE.md for complete development philosophy, quality thresholds, and toolchain preferences.
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Omitting Base Standards

Never generate a CLAUDE.md without the philosophy and quality sections. A project-specific-only CLAUDE.md is incomplete.

### 2. Style Guidelines in Agent Config

Never include linting rules—use deterministic tools instead:

```markdown
<!-- BAD -->
## Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Always use semicolons

<!-- GOOD -->
## Lint
`npm run lint -- --fix path/to/file.ts`
```

### 3. Vague Instructions

```markdown
<!-- BAD -->
Write clean code and follow best practices.

<!-- GOOD -->
Use functional components with hooks. Extract shared logic into custom hooks in `src/hooks/`.
```

### 4. Duplicate Information

Don't repeat what's in README or package.json. Reference instead:

```markdown
See `README.md` for detailed setup instructions.
```

### 5. Hotfix-Style Rules

Avoid temporary workarounds that don't apply universally:

```markdown
<!-- BAD -->
When working on auth, remember to update the session timeout.

<!-- GOOD - put in separate doc -->
See `docs/auth.md` for authentication workflow details.
```

### 6. Project-Wide Commands for File Operations

```markdown
<!-- BAD -->
Run `npm test` to verify changes.

<!-- GOOD -->
- Full suite: `npm test`
- Single file: `npm test -- path/to/file.test.ts`
- Watch mode: `npm test -- --watch path/to/file.test.ts`
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Base standards (Philosophy, Quality Limits, Error Handling, Testing, Completion Protocol) are included
- [ ] CLI Tool Preferences filtered to relevant stack
- [ ] ≤150 lines total (ideally ≤60 for CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] All commands are file-scoped where possible
- [ ] Real code examples, not descriptions
- [ ] No style rules (use linter instead)
- [ ] No secrets or absolute paths
- [ ] References detailed docs rather than embedding them
- [ ] Each instruction is universally applicable
- [ ] Coding rules file generated at `.claude/rules/coding-rules.md`

## Iteration Strategy

After initial creation:

1. Use the agent on real tasks
2. Note where it struggles or makes mistakes
3. Add rules only for repeated issues
4. Remove rules that don't improve outcomes

The best agent configs evolve through usage, not upfront planning.
