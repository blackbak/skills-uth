# Creative Brief: Orthopaedic Practice Homepage

**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Deliverable:** Homepage (3-section)
**Status:** active

## What to Build

A 3-section homepage for a local orthopaedic surgery practice. Single self-contained index.html file. No stock photo URLs -- all imagery must be CSS/SVG-based or omitted. The page serves as the primary entry point for patients seeking orthopaedic care.

## Target Audience

**Primary persona:** Active adults (30-55) with sports injuries or joint pain, and older adults (55+) facing arthritis or joint replacement. Both segments are searching for a trusted, local orthopaedic surgeon.
**Context:** Organic search ("orthopaedic surgeon near me"), GP/physio referral, or word of mouth. Landing directly on the homepage.
**Mindset:** In pain or discomfort. Looking for someone trustworthy, credentialed, and available soon. Comparing options. Want reassurance this is the right doctor.

## Key Constraints

- **Brand:** Design system at docs/DESIGN/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md -- use exact tokens
- **Tech stack:** Single self-contained HTML file (inline CSS + JS). No external dependencies except Google Fonts (Inter).
- **Must include:** 3 distinct sections, clear CTA for booking appointments, trust signals (credentials, experience), service overview
- **Must avoid:** Stock photo URLs, medical jargon, graphic surgical imagery, generic corporate feel
- **Responsive:** Desktop + mobile

## Success Criteria

- Patient can understand what the practice offers within 5 seconds
- Clear path to book an appointment from any section
- Conveys warmth and clinical expertise simultaneously
- Fully responsive and accessible (WCAG AA)
- Single file, opens directly in browser
