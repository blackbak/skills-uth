# Round 1 -- Copywriter Response

## Answering Your Questions

**1. Reassurance vs. aspiration in the hero headline.**

Reassurance. This audience is mid-decision, in pain, and comparing surgeons. They do not need to be sold on wanting to move again -- they already want that desperately. What they need is to believe this specific practice can deliver it. Aspiration works when people are browsing. Reassurance works when people are choosing.

The headline should land a concrete trust signal, not a feeling. Something closer to "Fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon. Same-week appointments." than "Get back to the life you love." The aspiration can live in the subheadline, once the trust is established.

**2. Credentials woven in vs. standalone stats.**

Standalone stats. Three reasons: the audience is scanning, not reading. Pain shortens attention spans. And bold stat blocks ("15+ years / 3,000+ procedures / same-week appointments") pass the 5-second comprehension test from the brief. Weaving credentials into prose buries them. The copy around the stats can be warm and human -- the stats themselves should be blunt.

## Reactions to the Three Directions

**Direction A: "Steady Hands" -- strong choice for copy.**
The generous whitespace and restrained visual language give the headline room to do its job. The pulse-line divider is smart -- it adds character without competing with the message. Anatomical line drawings ground the page in orthopaedics without needing explanation. Copy can be direct and sparse here. This layout supports the scan-then-read behavior our audience will have.

**Direction B: "Back in Motion" -- risks undermining the message.**
The gradient, scroll animations, and oversized typography create visual energy that fights the emotional register these patients arrive with. Someone Googling "knee surgeon near me" at 11pm with a swollen joint does not want to feel inspired. They want to feel safe. The motion silhouettes also push toward aspiration before we have earned trust. Copy would have to work against the design to ground the page.

**Direction C: "Trusted Neighbor" -- safe but limiting.**
No objections from a copy standpoint. It would work. But it gives copy nothing to lean into visually -- no signature moment, no distinctive recall. Every other local medical practice looks like this. The split layout in section three is practical, though. Worth borrowing for Direction A.

**I agree with your recommendation: Direction A.**

## One Concern, One Question

**Concern:** The card grid in section two needs hierarchy. If all four service cards look identical, the patient has to read all four to find theirs. Can we visually distinguish "I have a sports injury" from "I need a joint replacement" from "I broke something"? Even just icon differentiation would help copy direct traffic.

**Question:** In section three (trust/credentials), is there room for a secondary CTA path? The primary action is "book an appointment," but some patients -- especially older adults and referral patients -- want to call. If the layout only supports one CTA block, I will write for booking. If there is room for a phone number with equal visual weight, that changes the copy structure.
