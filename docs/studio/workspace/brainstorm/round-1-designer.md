# Round 1 -- Designer Brief

**Deliverable:** 3-section homepage (single HTML file)
**Audience:** People in pain -- active adults with sports injuries, older adults facing joint replacement. They landed here from a Google search or a GP referral. They are comparing options, looking for trust and availability.

## Analysis

The design system is tight: deep blue (#1B4D7A), teal accent (#2A9D8F), Inter throughout, 12-column grid, clean card-based components. The brand wants warmth + clinical expertise simultaneously. No stock photos allowed -- all imagery must be CSS/SVG. Three sections, one CTA goal: book an appointment.

The real tension here: medical trust usually comes from coldness (sterile, clinical, authoritative). But this brand explicitly rejects that. We need to feel like a confident surgeon who also remembers your name.

## Three Directions

### Direction A: "Steady Hands"

**Visual:** Quiet confidence. Hero section uses generous whitespace with a large, grounded headline. Subtle SVG line illustrations of anatomical joints (knee, shoulder, hip) rendered in the primary blue as thin strokes -- precise, not decorative. Cards sit on the light secondary background with barely-there borders. The teal accent appears only on CTAs and one signature element -- a thin animated pulse line (like a vitals monitor) that runs horizontally between sections.

**Structure:** (1) Hero -- headline + sub + CTA + trust badges inline. (2) Services -- 3-4 card grid with SVG icons. (3) Trust/credentials -- surgeon bio snippet, key stats (years, procedures, same-week availability), final CTA.

**Distinctive:** The pulse-line divider. It says "alive, precise, monitored" without being clinical. The anatomical line drawings say orthopaedic without stock photos.

### Direction B: "Back in Motion"

**Visual:** Movement-forward. Hero has a CSS gradient that shifts subtly from the deep blue to teal across the viewport -- not garish, more like light moving across water. Section transitions use scroll-triggered fade-and-rise animations. SVG silhouettes of people in motion (walking, running, reaching overhead) anchor each section. Typography leans into size contrast -- oversized H1 paired with compact body text.

**Structure:** (1) Hero -- emotional headline about returning to life + CTA. (2) Three-column "journey" -- Diagnose / Treat / Recover, each with a motion silhouette and short copy. (3) Credentials + appointment strip with location and hours.

**Distinctive:** The gradient and motion silhouettes make this feel aspirational rather than clinical. It foregrounds the outcome (movement) over the intervention (surgery).

### Direction C: "The Trusted Neighbor"

**Visual:** Grounded warmth. No gradients, no animation tricks. A solid white hero with a bold headline in primary-dark, a warm teal rule underneath, and a prominent CTA. Below, a lightly tinted (#F7F9FC) section with rounded cards featuring generous padding and clear iconography. Final section: a simple two-column layout -- credentials on one side, a "ready to book?" block on the other. Everything feels like a well-organized, welcoming clinic waiting room.

**Structure:** (1) Hero -- direct value prop + CTA + inline trust indicators. (2) Services overview -- icon cards. (3) Split: credentials + booking prompt.

**Distinctive:** Radical simplicity. No effects competing for attention. Trust comes from clarity, not spectacle. Loads instantly, reads instantly.

## Recommendation

**Direction A: "Steady Hands."** It threads the needle between warmth and precision that the brand demands. The anatomical SVG lines and pulse divider give it a signature visual identity without stock photos or gimmicks. It is restrained enough for older adults who want trust, distinctive enough to not feel like every other medical practice site. Direction B risks feeling too slick for the audience. Direction C is safe but forgettable.

## Questions for Copywriter

1. **What should the hero headline accomplish -- reassurance or aspiration?** "You are in expert hands" (trust-first) vs. "Get back to the life you love" (outcome-first). The audience is in pain and comparing surgeons. Which emotional register lands harder for someone mid-decision?

2. **How much should credentials be woven into the copy vs. displayed as standalone trust signals?** We could thread fellowship training and procedure counts naturally into section copy, or isolate them as bold stats (e.g., "15+ years / 3,000+ procedures / same-week appointments"). The latter is faster to scan but less narrative.
