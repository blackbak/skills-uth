# Creative Direction: Steady Hands

## Visual Direction

Quiet confidence anchored in deep blue (#1B4D7A) with teal (#2A9D8F) reserved exclusively for CTAs and the signature pulse-line divider. White hero with generous whitespace gives the headline room to land. Secondary background (#F7F9FC) separates sections without heaviness. Thin-stroke SVG anatomical illustrations (knee, shoulder, hip) in primary blue provide orthopaedic identity without stock photos. Cards use distinct SVG icons per service category -- different shapes and line weights so patients can self-sort visually before reading. The animated horizontal pulse line between sections is the single motion element: precise, alive, not decorative. Inter throughout at the existing type scale. Mobile stacks to single column with the pulse line becoming a short centered accent.

## Messaging Direction

Reassurance-first. The hero headline leads with a concrete credential ("Fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon") and pairs it with availability ("Same-week appointments"). Aspiration lives in the subheadline only, after trust is established. Copy is sparse and scannable -- pain shortens attention. Credentials appear as bold standalone stat blocks (years, procedures, availability), not woven into prose. Warm human tone wraps around blunt numbers. Primary CTA is "Book an Appointment" in teal. Section three includes a phone number with equal visual weight as a secondary path -- older adults and referral patients expect to call. CTA copy stays action-specific, never generic.

## Page Structure

1. **Hero** -- Credential-led headline, aspirational subheadline, teal CTA button, inline trust badges (board certified, fellowship trained, same-week availability)
2. **Services** -- 3-4 cards on #F7F9FC background, each with a distinct SVG icon (sports injury / joint replacement / fracture care / general orthopaedics), short direct copy, no card links (CTA stays unified)
3. **Trust + Booking** -- Two-column split: left side has surgeon name, key stats as bold blocks, one-line bio; right side has "Ready to book?" block with primary CTA button and phone number at equal visual weight

## Key Decisions

- **Reassurance over aspiration in the hero.** The audience is mid-decision and in pain. They need to trust this surgeon, not be inspired about movement. Aspiration earns its place in the subheadline, not the headline.
- **Standalone stat blocks over narrative credentials.** Pain compresses attention. Bold numbers (15+ years, 3,000+ procedures) pass the 5-second scan test. Warm copy surrounds them but does not bury them.
- **Distinct service card icons, not uniform cards.** Patients arrive with a specific problem. Visual differentiation lets them self-sort ("that is my injury") before reading, reducing cognitive load.
- **Dual CTA paths: booking button + phone number.** Older adults and referral patients default to calling. A booking-only layout loses them. Both paths get equal visual weight in section three.
- **Single motion element (pulse line) over distributed animation.** One signature detail remembered is worth more than scattered effects forgotten. The pulse line says "alive and precise" without competing with the message.
